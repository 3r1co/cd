# Jenkins CI Server (1 hour)

Throughout the course, you used Github Actions as your CI/CD Platform. In order to give you an overview about the most popular Open Source solution, we will deploy the Jenkins Build server in this Lab.

We will use the guideline provided by AWS [here](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Projects/P5505030/aws-project_Jenkins-build-server.pdf).

After Jenkins is installed, create your first pipeline as described [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/).
