# Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (30 minutes)

In order to start, please read carefully the instructions on Pod Security Policies in EKS provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-security-policy.html)

You will have to delete the default eks.privileged Pod Security Policy before you can apply the example provided below.

Please follow the example provided by Kubernetes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#example)

Please revert your Pod Security Policy to the standard eks.privileged after you performed the exercise.
The description how to do so is mentioned on the bottom of the first page.
