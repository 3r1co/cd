# Dynamic Application Security Scanning (1 hour)

Similar to ZAP Proxy, [Arachni](https://www.arachni-scanner.com) is a DAST tool that is intended to run on the command line.

Unfortunately, there is no Github Action available for this tool, so your task today is to write your own Github Action, including Arachni and performing a scan on your application.
