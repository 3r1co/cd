# Docker Vulnerability Scanning with Clair (1 hour)

The goal of this exercise is to show you how to create a CI/CD Pipeline for containerized applications.  
At the end of this lab, you have a CI/CD pipeline, that
* checks out your application source code
* builds a Docker image
* deploys this Docker image to Kubernetes
