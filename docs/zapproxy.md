# Dynamic Application Security Scanning (1 hour)

Until now you scanned your application in a static way, meaning you found vulnerabilties before an artifact was actually built.

A complementary way to uncover weaknesses is the **Dynamic Application Security Scanning**, also known as DAST.

One famous scanner is the OWASP ZAP Proxy.

Your task is now to integrate the ZAP Proxy Github Action [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/action-baseline) in your Github workflow.
