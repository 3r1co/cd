# Static Code Analysis with PMD (1 hour)

Another tool to scan your source for vulnerabilities is **PMD**. It can be good to use several different source code scanners in order to find the maximum number of vulnerabilities and improve the quality of your code.

There is already a Github Action available for PMD [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pmd-source-code-analyzer-action).

Your exercise is to integrate this tool into your Github workflow.
