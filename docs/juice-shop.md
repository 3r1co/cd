# Juice Shop (1 hour)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

In this lab, you will deploy the Juice Shop, which we will use in later tutorial to analyze weaknesses.
