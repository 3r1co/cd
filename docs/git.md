# Git

In order to succeed in collaborative development, it's important to know the basics about Git
In this practice section, please work in pairs:

- Each of you creates a new Git repository
- Create a feature branch with the command `git checkout -b a-new-feature`
- Create a new file, add it (with `git add .`) and commit it to the new branch (with `git commit -am "Adding a new file"`)
- Push the new branch to Github.com
- Fork the repository of your peer
- Create a feature branch in the forked repository
- Push the changes in the feature branch to Github.com
- Open a Pull request to the original repository
